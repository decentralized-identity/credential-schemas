# DIF Draft Schemas Repository

Welcome to the DIF Schemas repository. This shared repository acts as a common storage location for credential schemas, enabling standardized and easy access to schemas across different contributors. 

## DIF Draft Schemas and Standardization

The schemas present in this folder are **draft schemas** that are currently being reviewed by the DIF Schemas WG. Will be moved to the [DIF Recommended Schemas](../dif-recommended-schemas) folder once approved.
