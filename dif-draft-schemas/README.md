# DIF Draft Schemas Repository

Welcome to the DIF Schemas repository. This shared repository acts as a common storage location for credential schemas, enabling standardized and easy access to schemas across different contributors. 

## DIF Draft Schemas and Standardization

The schemas present in this folder are **draft schemas** that are currently being reviewed by the DIF Schemas WG. This stage corresponds to the "Draft" and "Working Group Approved" stages of the [DIF Work Item Lifecycle](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/org/blob/main/work-item-lifecycle.md). Once approved by TSC, schemas will be moved to the [DIF Recommended Schemas](../dif-recommended-schemas) folder, representing the "Final Approval" stage.
