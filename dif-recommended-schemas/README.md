# DIF Schemas Repository

Welcome to the DIF Schemas repository. This shared repository acts as a common storage location for credential schemas, enabling standardized and easy access to schemas across different contributors. 

## DIF Recommended Schemas (Standardized Schemas)

The schemas present in this folder are **recommended schemas** that have been approved by the DIF. They are the result of a standardization process that involves the DIF Schemas WG and other stakeholders. They can be used as **standard** schemas for interoperability and compliance.  

## Storage and Versioning

The schemas stored in the `dif-recommended-schemas` folder are guaranteed to be immutable. Once a schema is added to this folder, it will **never** be removed or modified. Therefore the url pointing to the schema can be considered a **permanent and immutable** reference to the schema.
