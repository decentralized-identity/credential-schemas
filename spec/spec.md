## Patent Policy

The Decentralized Identity Foundation has adopted the W3C Patent Policy (2004), as detailed below:

- **Licensing Commitment.** Each contributor agrees to make available any of its
  Essential Claims, as defined in the W3C Patent Policy (available at
  http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205), under the W3C RF licensing
  requirements Section 5 (http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205), as
  if the contribution was contained in or associated with a W3C Recommendation.

- **For Exclusion.** Prior to committing any code, bug reports, pull requests, or
  other forms of contribution, a contributor may exclude Essential Claims from its
  licensing commitments under this agreement by providing written notice of that
  intent to DIF's Executive Director (and must received confirmation of receipt
  for the exclusion to have effect). The Exclusion Notice for issued patents and
  published applications must include the patent number(s) or title and
  application number(s), as the case may be, for each of the issued patent(s) or
  pending patent application(s) that the contributor wishes to exclude from the
  licensing commitment set forth in Section 1 of this patent policy. If an issued
  patent or pending patent application that may contain Essential Claims is not
  set forth in the Exclusion Notice, those Essential Claims shall continue to be
  subject to the licensing commitments under this agreement. The Exclusion Notice
  for unpublished patent applications must provide either: (i) the text of the
  filed application; or (ii) identification of the specific part(s) of the
  contribution whose implementation makes the excluded claim an Essential Claim.
  If (ii) is chosen, the effect of the exclusion will be limited to the identified
  part(s) of the contribution. DIF's Executive Director will publish Exclusion
  Notices.
