### Basic Person Schema

#### Purpose: 
The purpose of this credential schema is to define the fields required to identify an individual at a basic level for KYC purposes. The schema integrates fields from various standards including: [Open ID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) , [Open ID for Identity Assurance](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0.html) , and EBSI for natural person. 

Use cases: Utilized across financial services, telecommunications, and any sector requiring identity verification for customer onboarding, transaction verification, and regulatory compliance, enabling streamlined and standardized data handling for KYC procedures.

Alignments
OpenID Connect Core
OIDC for Identity Assurance 
EBSI


::: note Basic Note
  The schema excludes assurance levels and the verification process by which the data was obtained.

::: todo add decide on nationality codes
  Need to add decide on 2 letter vs. 3 letter iso codes. The ISO mdl standard uses 2 letter codes, however the ICAO standard uses the iso 3 letter codes and include some country codes that are not recognized by the UN yet (example Kosovo, Palestine).
