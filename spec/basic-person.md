### Basic Person Schema

October 2024 - **Specification Status:** Working Group draft

JSON Schema: [Basic Person Schema](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/credential-schemas/tree/main/dif-draft-schemas/basic-person-schema)

#### Purpose: 
The purpose of this credential schema specification is to define the fields required to identify an individual at a basic level for KYC purposes. The schema integrates fields from various standards including: [Open ID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) , [Open ID for Identity Assurance](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0.html) , and [EBSI for natural person](https://code.europa.eu/ebsi/json-schema/-/tree/main/schemas/vcdm1.1/multi-uni-pilot/verifiable-attestation-individual-id). Harmonization and mapping of the fields was done to facilitate interoperability with these standards.

Use cases: Mainly for financial services, but can also be used in telecommunications, and any sector requiring identity verification for customer onboarding, transaction verification, and regulatory compliance, enabling streamlined and standardized data handling for KYC procedures.

::: note Basic Note
  The schema excludes assurance levels and the verification process by which the data was obtained.
:::

For issuance date and expiration date fields please refer to the verifiable credentials data model [version 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) or [version 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/) (we assume the usage of these fields).

#### Contact Channel Object
The Contact Channel Object records the various contact methods of the credential subject (email, phone, others). The type of contact channel is indicated by the contactChannelType property. 

Depending on the type of contact channel some formatting rules apply: 

- email: value MUST conform to the RFC 5322 [RFC5322] addr-spec syntax.
- phone numbers: phone number values must be formatted according to ITU-T recommendation [E.164], e.g., "1999550123" or "50688785073".

::: note Contact channel verification
  It is assumed that the credential issuer will have verified that the credential subject is in possession of the contact channel(s), the details of how this verification is done are outside the scope of this specification.
