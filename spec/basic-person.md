### Basic Person Schema

#### Purpose: 
The purpose of this credential schema is to define the fields required to identify an individual at a basic level for KYC purposes. The schema integrates fields from various standards including: [Open ID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) , [Open ID for Identity Assurance](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0.html) , and [EBSI for natural person](https://code.europa.eu/ebsi/json-schema/-/tree/main/schemas/vcdm1.1/multi-uni-pilot/verifiable-attestation-individual-id). 

Use cases: Utilized across financial services, telecommunications, and any sector requiring identity verification for customer onboarding, transaction verification, and regulatory compliance, enabling streamlined and standardized data handling for KYC procedures.

Field names use "camelCase" and only the minimal fields are required, however required fields will be dependent on the implementer and use case.

Country codes use the ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes (e.g. FRA, USA, CRC), this allows to accomodate use cases in which some countries are not fully recognized by the UN (example: Kosovo or Palestine) are represented with 3 letter codes in some standards such as [ICAO Doc 9303](https://www.icao.int/publications/Documents/9303_p3_cons_en.pdf).

::: note Basic Note
  The schema excludes assurance levels and the verification process by which the data was obtained.
:::

### Enumerations: 

Given that the enumeration fields (such as nameType, identifierType, addressType, contactChannelType) may not accommodate all possible values, implementers are allowed to substitute these enumeration strings with an object that includes the value and a "enumDefinition" field which points to a custom enumeration. If the field value is just a string then the default enumeration is assumed.

Please see below for an example of both possibilities.

Enumeration field where the default enumeration is assumed:

::: example Identifier with default enum
  identifierType: "passport"
:::

Enumeration field where a custom enumeration is used:

::: example Identifier with custom enum
  identifierType: {
      value: "digitalPassport",
      enumDefinition: https://example.com/myPassportTypes
   }
:::
