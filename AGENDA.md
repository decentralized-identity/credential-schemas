Please note that we might not notice a pullrequest in time, but you are free to propose agenda items for future meetings via hackmd._

4. Discussion
    - How did you reconcile aligning with other standards:
        - OpenID and EBSI didn't differ much: casing
        - Feedback from partners
    - How did you handle naming:
        - Provided both to allow full name and piece-by-piece (surname, etc)
    - Interest in discoverability of registries
        - There is a precedent of this in DIF; we're thinking about re-activating, based on member feedback
        - Schemas could live here or elsewhere
    - Suggestion to take mdl schema and align as closely as possible. Input will be coming from passports or driver's license
        - Not an either/or; we'll double-check to help ensure alignment
    - Use cases?
5. Action items and next steps
    - How do we talk about the ISO mdl without paying for it?
    - KYC Use Cases
    - Align with ISO mdl
